## Introduction
The Memory Game is a console-based C++ application that tests and improves memory skills through the classic card-matching game. Featuring multiple difficulty levels and dynamic board sizes, the game offers a challenging experience for all players, from beginners to advanced.

## Features
- Adaptive difficulty levels for the computer opponent.
- Single-player mode against the computer and a two-player mode for head-to-head play.
- Configurable board sizes (Small, Medium, Large) to adjust gameplay complexity.
- An elegant console interface with ANSI color codes for a visually engaging experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compliant compiler
- CMake 3.14 or higher for building the project

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lironfarzam/memory-game.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd memory-game
   ```
3. **Build the project:**
   - Create a build directory and navigate into it:
     ```sh
     mkdir build && cd build
     ```
   - Generate the makefile and build the project:
     ```sh
     cmake .. && make
     ```
4. **Run the game:**
   ```sh
   ./MemoryGame
   ```

## Game Architecture

### Class Structure
- **Game:** Manages game flow, including setup and player turns.
- **Board:** Handles the game board, tracking card states and matches.
- **Card:** Represents individual game cards.
- **Player:** Abstract base class for players, with derived classes for human and computer players.
- **HumanPlayer:** Manages interactions for human players.
- **ComputerPlayer:** Simulates an opponent with varying strategies.
- **Utility:** Provides utility functions for the game interface.

### ComputerPlayer's Difficulty Strategy
The ComputerPlayer's strategy varies with difficulty levels, from random card selection to strategic recall of previously seen cards, offering engaging gameplay across all levels.

## Building the Project with CMake
- **Compile the project:** Instructions for using CMake to build the project, as detailed in the [Building the Project with CMake](#building-the-project-with-cmake) section.
- **Running the executable:** How to run the compiled game from the terminal.

## Coding Best Practices
The Memory Game is developed with modern C++ best practices in mind, including consistent coding styles, effective memory management using smart pointers, and modular design for maintainability.
